# Sign-Langnuage-to-Text-Conversion


This project implements real-time **sign language recognition** and converts hand gestures into text using **MediaPipe** for hand tracking and **OpenCV** for video processing. The system helps bridge communication gaps for individuals who use sign language by translating gestures into readable text.

## 🔍 Overview

**Sign language** is a crucial communication tool for the hearing and speech-impaired community. This project aims to develop a **gesture-to-text conversion system** by:
- Detecting and tracking **hand landmarks** in real time.
- Recognizing static hand gestures and mapping them to **text output**.
- Providing an interactive **GUI/Web App** for users to translate signs.
